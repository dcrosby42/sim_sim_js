  et al!


Actual Serialization!
  None of the server, client, user, sim, or gameevents utilizes any real serialization.
  EVERYTHING IS JUST JS OBJECTS AT PRESENT
    -> expecting to be JSON-ified behind the scenes by SocketIO
  ...BUT WAIT until proving out the logic of the system top-to-bottom, it should work
  (but we need packing eventually for efficiency)
